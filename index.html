						Hello! My name is Dan. I live in Milwaukie, Oregon with my wife. We
						have two kids, two dogs, and one obnoxious cat.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have worked in IT for about six years. I enjoy my job but I would
						love to do something more fulfilling. I want to make something!
					</p>

					<p>
						Other than computers my interests include triathlons, guitars,
						reading, and video games. Last year my wife challenged me to enter a
						triathlon with her even though I didn't know how to swim. I spent
						ten months teaching myself to swim at the gym before our event. When
						the day arrived we were both immediately hooked. We entered two more
						triathlons before the end of the summer. I am mostly interested in
						running and ran my first ever marathon just last week!
